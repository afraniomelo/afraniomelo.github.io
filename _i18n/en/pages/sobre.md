Hello, welcome! Here I share a bit of my work. Access texts, classes, links, and resources in the tabs at the top of the page. Check out contact information and additional details in the icons above. Below is a summary.

As a chemical engineer and data scientist:

- I work at [Petrobras](https://petrobras.com.br/en/) developing [research and innovation](https://petrobras.com.br/en/inovacao-e-tecnologia/centro-de-pesquisa) in the field of [oil and gas exploration and production](https://petrobras.com.br/en/quem-somos/exploracao-e-producao), with a focus on [artificial lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_lift) and [flow assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_assurance) technologies.
- I have a bachelor's degree from [EQ/UFRJ](http://novo.eq.ufrj.br/en/home-en/) and a master's and doctoral degree in chemical engineering from [COPPE/UFRJ](https://www.coppe.ufrj.br/en). Over these twelve years of education, I had the honor of being guided by [José Carlos Pinto](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6479420970768737), [Fernando Pellegrini](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6669992155373315), [Maurício Melo Câmara](http://lattes.cnpq.br/8161545819744234), and [Heloísa Sanches](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2840875338255590).
- As a member of the [EngePol Group](https://www.instagram.com/engepolgrupo/), I participated in research projects on the interface between data science and systems engineering in processes, developing methodologies for monitoring industrial processes.
- I have published scientific articles in journals such as [Computers & Chemical Engineering](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-chemical-engineering), [Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/iecred), among others.
- I developed and maintain the [KydLIB](https://github.com/afraniomelo/kydlib) library for exploratory data analysis mainly from industrial time series.
- I volunteered for the NGO [Engineers Without Borders (RJ)](https://esf.org.br/nucleo-rio-de-janeiro/).

As a lecturer: 

- I taught the course [Data Science and Machine Learning in the Process Industry](https://afraniomelo.github.io/projects/ds_ml/) at the [Prof. Giulio Massarani Pilot School](http://www.escolapiloto.peq.coppe.ufrj.br/). The [twelve video lessons in Portuguese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iE3JsQpU_U&list=PLvr45Arc0UpzsRhzq3q4_KmZcm0utwvvB) are available on YouTube.
- I taught the courses [Mass Transfer](https://afraniomelo.github.io/projects/eqe476/) and [Unit Operations I](https://afraniomelo.github.io/projects/eqe473/) for one year at [EQ/UFRJ](http://novo.eq.ufrj.br/en/home-en/).
- I taught Chemistry for ten years at the [Social Pre-University Course (Pré-Vestibular Social, PVS) of the CECIERJ Foundation](https://www.cecierj.edu.br/pre-vestibular-social/).
- I conducted short courses on programming in [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/code/afrniomelo/curso-rel-mpago-de-python/notebook), [Matlab](https://afraniomelo.github.io/projects/matlab/), and [C/C++](https://afraniomelo.github.io/projects/c/).

As a literary writer:

- I participated in the anthologies [Furos na carne](https://www.bestiario.com.br/livros/furos_na_carne.html) (Bestiário - 2022), [Questão de tempo](https://www.editorapersona.com/product-page/quest%C3%A3o-de-tempo) (Persona - 2022), Contos fantásticos (CBJE - 2017), Nó em pingo d'água (CBJE - 2016), and Histórias necessárias (Big Time - 2015).
- I won the [Hernâni Cidade Literary Award](http://premioliterariohernanicidade.blogspot.com/) in 2021, offered by the municipality of [Redondo](https://www.cm-redondo.pt/) (Évora - Portugal), with the short story [Pearl door](https://afraniomelo.github.io/en/projects/porta_de_perola/).
- In 2021, I attended the 36th edition of the [Literary Creation Workshop at PUC-RS](https://www.pucrs.br/humanidades/oficina-de-criacao-literaria/), conducted by [Luiz Antonio de Assis Brasil](http://www.laab.com.br/vida.html).
- I am currently immersed in the writing of Asymptote, my first novel.
