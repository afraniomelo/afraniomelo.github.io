	abstract = {Predictive analytics is usually cited as one of the most important pillars of the digital transformation. For the oil industry, speciﬁcally, it is a common belief that issues like integrity and maintenance could beneﬁt from predictive analytics. This paper presents the development and the application of a process-monitoring tool in a real process facility. The PMA (Predictive Maintenance Application) system is a data-driven application that uses a multivariate analysis in order to predict the system behavior. Results show that the use of a multivariate approach for process monitoring could not only detect an early failure at a metering system days before the operation crew, but could also successfully identify, among hundreds of variables, the root cause of the abnormal situation. By applying such an approach, a better performance of the monitored equipment is expected, decreasing its downtime.},

	abstract = {In this paper a semi-automatic computationally inexpensive system is developed and implemented for monitoring and fault detection of industrial processes. The system uses a soft sensor based on Echo State Networks (ESN) and is able to capture the non-linear dynamic relationships in the process data, making it convenient for real-time monitoring applications. The soft sensor is set to simulate normal operating conditions, so that when the process is governed by other causes, possibly in failure, high residues occur and allow the failure identification. In addition, the system monitors the reliability of the model predictions by tracking the internal states of the ESN dynamic reservoir, indicating whether the model predictions can be used instead of the measured data. The system is successfully applied to the Mackey-Glass Anomaly Benchmark (MGAB) and to the monitoring of critical pieces of equipment of a real oil and gas plant.},

	abstract = {Variable selection constitutes an essential step to reduce dimensionality and improve performance of fault detection and diagnosis in large scale industrial processes. For this reason, in this paper, variable selection approaches based on causality are proposed and compared, in terms of model adjustment of available data and fault detection performance, with several other filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded-based variable selection methods. These approaches are applied in a simulated benchmark case and an actual oil and gas industrial case considering four different learning models. The experimental results show that obtained models presented better performance during the fault detection stage when variable selection procedures based on causality were used for purpose of model building.},

	abstract = {In the present study, a previously proposed mathematical model is improved with inclusion of the energy balance, considering the Joule–Thomson effect and the heat exchange between the retentate and permeate streams, in order to explain the temperature effects observed in actual industrial sites, which requires attention to potential problems and failures, such as gas condensation that damages the dense polymeric membrane, reducing separation efficiency. The proposed model was validated with real industrial data and was able to represent the phenomena at different operation conditions, as characterized through extensive sensitivity analyses. In order to do this, a methodology for data acquisition, pre-treatment, characterization, and data reconciliation was employed. Also, an algorithm based on Oriented-Object Programming (OOP) was proposed and implemented to simulate the real membrane separation offshore unit, considering the different configuration levels of the membrane separation setup for the first time: trains, banks, tubes, elements, and leaves. It is shown that the proposed model constitutes a promising tool for design of membrane separation equipment at industrial scale, thanks to its flexibility, model robustness, and the efficiency of the numerical method, which allows the full mapping of dew points on the membrane leaf, which can be used to prevent undesired swelling and ageing of the membrane material.},
